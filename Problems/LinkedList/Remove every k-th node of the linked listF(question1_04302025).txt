Question:1 
Remove every K-th node of the linked list

	Given a singly linked list, the task is to remove every kth node of the linked list. Assume that k is always less than or equal to the length of the Linked List.
	

Solution : 

	The idea is to traverse the linked list while maintaining a counter to track node positions. 
	Every time the counter reaches k, update the next pointer of the previous node to skip the current kth node, effectively removing it from the list. 
	Continue this process until reaching the end of the list. This method ensures that the kth nodes are removed as required while preserving the rest of the list structure.
