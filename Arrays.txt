Question : 1 
you are given an array of integers in which each subsequent value is not less than the previous value.
Write a function that takes this array as an input and returns a new array with the squares of each number sorted in 
ascending order. 
Eg. 
input -> [1,3,5] 
output-> [1,9,25] 


input -> [0,5,6]
output-> [0,25,36]

input -> [-4,-2,0,1,3]
output-> [0,1,4,9,16]

Question : 2 
An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing. An array is 
monotone increasing if all it's elements from left to right are non-decreasing. An array is 
monotone decreasing if all it's elements from left to right are non-increasing. Given an array return true if the given array is monotonic , or false otherwise. 

[1,2,3,3] - monotone increasing
[3,2,1]   - monotone decreasing
[3,3,3]   -

Question : 4 
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store. Notice that you may not slant the container.
