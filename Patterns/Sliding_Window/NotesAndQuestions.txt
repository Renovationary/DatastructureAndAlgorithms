Sliding Window 
      is a powerful algoritmic approach used to solve problems involving arrays or lists where a subarray or subsequence is required to be analyzed. This technique allows you to 
reduce the time complexity of problems that would typically invloved nested loops , by maintaining a window of elements and sliding it across the array. The 
window can either can expandor shrink based on certain conditions, which helps in optimizing solution.

Question 1: 

Given ana array of integers and a number k , find the maximum sum of a subarray of size K . 

Examples : 
Input  : arr[] = {100,200,300,400} , k = 2
Output : 700

Input  : arr[] = {1,4,2,10,23,3,1,0,200} , k = 4 
Output : 39 
Explanation : We get maximum suum by adding subarray {4,2,10,23} of size 4 

Input  : arr[] = {2,3},k = 3 
Output : Invalid 
Explanation : There is no subarray of size 3 as size of whole array is 2
